# Using NFT Tokens in Oracle Blockchain

Modern societies suffer from the complex bureaucracy within the citizen-to-government processes. No matter the country you are coming from, you have faced bureaucratic gaps, mismatched data, or the need to reflect your personal data in multiple distinct systems.

In this project we will discover Oracle Blockchain Platform (OBP), and with App Builder, we will build our application.

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) are unique digital identifiers that cannot be copied, substituted, or subdivided, recorded in a blockchain, and that is used to certify authenticity and custodianship. NFT is the perfect digital twin for whatever kind of physical or digital asset which can be used to track any usage, event, status change, or any other kind of peculiarity which makes sense to be tracked. Blockchain will provide an easily accesible inmutable history of the asset, which will be really valuable for whatever entity or person interested in the tracking performed on the asset itself.

Using Oracle Blockchain we can create in minutes an Hyperledger Fabric network as a founder, or join whatever existing Hyperledger Fabric network as a participant. For the purpose of this HoL, we are going to create a new network in which there will be two participants:
- *Founder of the network*: ***aitbouna1***, a marketplace fot NFTs.

AppBuilder will help you to reduce considerably the complexity of the development, packaging, testing, and deployment of Hyperledger Fabric chaincodes, giving you the option to create them in different languages (TypeScript or Go).
