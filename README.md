# citizen-to-government-processes_Oracle_Blockchain_Platform

Modern societies suffer from the complex bureaucracy within the citizen-to-government processes. No matter the country you are coming from, you have faced bureaucratic gaps, mismatched data, or the need to reflect your personal data in multiple distinct systems.

In this project we will discover Oracle Blockchain Platform (OBP), and with App Builder, we will build our application.
